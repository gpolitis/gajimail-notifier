The Gajimail Notifier is an application that alerts you when you have new Gmail messages. It displays an icon in your system tray to let you know if you have unread Gmail messages. It uses [Gajim][2]'s DBus interface to send [mail notification queries][1] to Gmail and intercept their response. Multiple accounts are not supported. The icons that appear in the system tray are those of the [Claw Mail][3] email client.
